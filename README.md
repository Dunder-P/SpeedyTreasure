# SpeedyTreasure
Tool to speed-up writing PLC-dia Definitions for Onwards! To The Furthest End!! Go Forth Supreme PLC!!!! and [Unannounced Project].
I don't know Python this was just kind of hacked together. Unless these games get a modding scene idk how useful they'll actually be to anyone lol.

Run like any other Python script. 

Click load file to easily modify and add to an existing definition file.
When a treasure definition is added (or loaded from a file) it will appear at the bottom. Click on it and then click "Modify Selected Entry" to load the entry into the program.
When you are done modifying an entry/defining one from scratch, click "Add New Entry". 
When finished, click save.
This information will be exported in the format needed for use with Onwards! To The Furthest End!! Go Forth Supreme PLC!!!!* and [Unannounced Project]. 


*Onwards! To The Furthest End!! Go Forth Supreme PLC!!!!'s PLC-dia only has support for one definition (I do not know how it would react to the decimal IDs used for entries 2-8) and its value MUST be parsable as a float.
